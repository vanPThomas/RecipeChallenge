# RecipeChallenge
Creating a web-based application in C# for backend and React for frontend. 
The application will allow users to join challenges and post recipes which will be voted on 
by a set amount of jury members through a Tinder-like app, swiping up for a like and down for a dislike. 
Users will need to enter an e-mail address to participate, and will be able to receive newsletters detailing 
the winner of the challenge (and possibly information on other running challenges as well).
